Identifying signs of diabetic retinopathy in eye images. Using Deep Learning (Neural Networks) automatically classify eye images by the degree of diabetic retinopathy. As a tool aim is to use Googleâ€™s TensorFlow. Train and test with different neural nets like Convolutional Neural Networks.

Identifying signs of diabetic retinopathy in publicly available Messidor dataset using Deep Learning automatically classify eye images by the degree of diabetic retinopathy.
